I am a **full stack software developer** with a  background in **civil engineering** and a passion for problem solving, learning, building and collaboration. I have recently enjoyed channelling this energy towards creating software solutions while completing the Makers Academy 4-month immersive coding bootcamp. 

I started my career as a civil engineer for one of the UK's largest main contractors and experienced working on two of the biggest and most technically challenging projects in the country. Following on from this I co-founded a business providing project management services to private clients in the domestic construction sector. I am motivated by finding innovative solutions to problems and working with inspiring people which has drawn me towards the tech industry and coding.

## Skills

**Technical**
- During my time at Makers, I gained a solid foundation in **Test Driven Development** and **Object-Oriented Programming**. I have integrated these concepts into my problem-solving process, enabling me to break down complex problems into manageable parts and produce high-quality code. To showcase my skills, you can review my [tech test repository](https://github.com/HOOLAHAN/tech_tests/tree/main), which demonstrates my approach to problem-solving and code implementation.

- In my role as an engineer in construction, I held responsibility for managing the technical aspects of construction projects. This involved reviewing specifications, selecting appropriate materials and processes, and ensuring compliance with regulations. When issues arose on-site, I diligently documented them and collaborated with clients to devise and implement effective solutions. These experiences highlight my attention to detail and ability to comprehend and apply technical information effectively.

**Collaboration**
- Throughout my time at Makers, I actively participated in four group projects, where I embraced agile principles to facilitate seamless teamwork. I engaged in various collaborative practices such as pair programming, conducting stand-ups, sprint planning, code reviews, retrospectives, and team demos. By adopting these methodologies, our teams achieved innovation and efficiency, even while working remotely from different locations. This experience has shown me the immense value of effective collaboration and its positive impact on project outcomes.

- During my role as a project manager, I successfully oversaw a [£1.9M new-build](https://harbourcontractors.co.uk/projects) house project spanning two years. I effectively divided the project into manageable packages and contracted specialists to handle each segment. By establishing strong relationships and maintaining open lines of communication, I ensured the project's smooth progress. Whenever conflicts arose, I employed collaboration and effective communication to reach resolutions that benefited all stakeholders involved.

**Communication**
- While collaborating on the [Find A Film](https://github.com/HOOLAHAN/Find_A_Film) project with remote colleagues over the Christmas course break, we faced the challenge of balancing our diverse social schedules with work commitments. To overcome this, we maintained constant communication channels through Slack, Trello, Miro, and Figma. These platforms enabled us to collaborate effectively without the need for frequent meetings. Everyone on the team had a clear understanding of our current progress, future objectives, and how we could contribute individually. This experience exemplified my proficiency in remote collaboration and effective communication tools.

- Throughout the Makers course, I regularly engaged in pair programming, both in-person and remotely. This practice enhanced my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly and improved my teamwork skills. By switching roles between the driver and navigator, I honed my collaborative abilities and ensured that my commit messages were concise and informative.

- During my career in construction, I consistently emphasised clear and effective communication. It was crucial to provide accurate and comprehensive works information, ensuring proper understanding and adherence. I developed a habit of regularly checking in with installers to confirm alignment and address any concerns promptly.
