I am a **Full-Stack Software Developer** with a  background in **Civil Engineering** and a passion for problem solving, learning, building and collaboration. I have recently enjoyed channelling this energy towards creating software solutions while completing the Makers Academy 4-month immersive coding bootcamp. 

I started my career as a civil engineer for one of the UK's largest main contactors and experienced working on two of the biggest and most technically challenging projects in the country. Following on from this I co-founded a business providing project management services to private clients in the domestic construction sector. I am motivated by finding innovative solutions to problems and working with inspiring people which has drawn me towards the tech industry and coding.

## Skills

**Technical**
- During my time on the Makers course, I learned the fundamentals of **Test Driven Development** and **Object Oriented Programming**. I made these concepts core to my process for tackling problems to help me break down the problem into smaller more manageable parts and write better quality code. Example of my process in action can be seen in this [tech test repository](https://github.com/HOOLAHAN/tech_tests/tree/main)

- As an engineer in construction one of my primary responsibilities was to manage the technical side of the build. This includes reviewing specifications and selecting the correct materials/processes to achieve a result that complies. When mistakes were made on site, I was responsible for documenting the issues and liaising with the client to agree and implement the solution for rectification. This demonstrates my attention to detail and ability to understand technical information/concepts. 

**Collaboration**
- While on the Makers course, I have worked on 4 group projects and adopted the **agile principles** in the way we organised ourselves as a team. Pair programming, running stand-ups, sprint planning, code reviews, retros and doing demos for the team were daily practises and I saw the team reap all the benefits of being able to collaborate in this manner. Coming from an industry which values being physically present to be able to contribute, it has been refreshing to see how much more innovative and efficient teams can work while sometimes being on opposite ends of the country.

- I project managed a [£1.9M new-build](https://harbourcontractors.co.uk/projects) house over a 2-year period. Splitting this project up into packages, I awarded these contracts to specialists and managed their involvement in the project from start to finish. Relationship management and good communication were key to success in this environment and when conflicts arose, I would find resolution through further collaboration and communication.

**Communication**
- I collaborated on [Find A Film](https://github.com/HOOLAHAN/Find_A_Film) with 4 colleagues working remotely over the Christmas course break. One challenge we overcame was balancing our varying social schedules with work over this period. We overcame this by being very communicative over Slack, Trello, Miro and Figma. We were able to collaborate on this project without the need to hold regular meetings, and everyone had a clear picture of where the team was currently, where we were heading and how we could contribute. 

- I pair programmed either in person or remotely on a regular basis throughout the course. This was a great way to practise communication of technical concepts and good teamwork practise, regularly switching between driver and navigator and committing with clear/useful messages.

- I practised clear and effective communication during my career in construction. Ensuring works information was accurate and complete was important but also that it was properly briefed so that this information was being followed and understood. I learned to regularly check in with installers to confirm alignment.

## Work Experience

**Harbour Contractors Ltd** (Sep 2020 to Aug 2022) _Director_

- Co-founded a small-scale construction management firm focussing in the domestic sector. 
- Delivered a £1.9M new-build project and £800K extension for private clients.
- Used project management / organisational skills and took ownership of the whole process from start to finish.
- Managed a wide range of stakeholders. Reported on programme and budget on a regular basis to the client. Managed sub-contractors to ensure quality and resolved conflicts where required.

## Hobbies
- **Runner** - I find a post work run at least once a week is the best way to decompress and look after my mental/physical health!
- **Golfer** - On weekends you can often find me on the golf course (likely searching for the ball!)
- **Sailor** - This sport requires a lot of focus and tactical thinking to get the best out of the boat in the ever- changing conditions!
